### to continue grabbing and make next "volumes" of (nearly) original images

use the same set of sources, exclude unreacheble, maybe include new - if valuable
periodicity based on Safebooru 100.000-group, currently ~4 months
 - 2020C for june-september 2020 rectifying
 - 2020D till the end of 2020 collecting
the same quality requirements - to be surely DRY (DontRepeateYourself)

### next release of metadata and thumbnails

at the beginning of 2021
 - add 2020 volumes
 - maybe back to past and include 2014 and 2015 volumes, prior to 2016(W) 
   * there are initial images with the same "technical" requirements
   * much worse in visual average quality (attractiveness)
mostly the same - compatible -  metadata, maybe some new ones
1024x1024 thumbnails for 2020 ???
