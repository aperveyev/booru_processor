### ENGLISH: datasets and software for Booru (painted or CG characters, mostly anime style) image processing

Here is a hobbie project inspired by results of https://www.thiswaifudoesnotexist.net/ and it's technical background - https://www.gwern.net/TWDNE and dataset https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2018 , algorithms and software available for free use.

This activity goals are:
* to arrange available metadata, software, scripts and models for the subject
* to collect (and create) training image datasets ("thumbnails") with good quality and metadata background
* an attempt to build usable tools for imagesets & metadata analysis and processing, e.g.
  - scene composition classification
  - visual attractiveness estimation
