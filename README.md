Code and texts about Booru (anime style) image processing

Inspired by dataset : https://www.gwern.net/Danbooru2018
which can be used for creation of trained models for services like http://kanotype.iptime.org:8003/deepdanbooru/
and local use https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/akbc11/p_tag_estimation_for_animestyle_girl_image/

At a time my tasks are:
- to develop image set segmentation methods and tools
- to analyze high level character (so - copyrights) tags usage

with strategic goal to create a usable tool (including model) for:
- general image composition classification
- anime characters recognition
- image attractiveness (visual quality) prediction
